# Eliane's Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio created for the Bootcamp second assignment. It contains HTML and CSS in order to complete this assignment. 


Learning all the codes during my HTML and CSS makes me eager to put my codes in action! It is amazing how this codes makes a webpage looks so beautiful. 

This project is built for me to put what I have taken from my HTML and CSS lessons into action and learning new tools along the way. It was my first project to build a website from scratch and I had many difficulties such as aligning the wordings to my desire outlook, choosing the right properties to put into my CSS selectors,learn to debug my own codes along the way too. I worked on many trial and error and eventually I got there. 

* Choosing the right element headings for each section or div.
* Break each of the section down while working part by part. (eg, heading, about me, my portfolio, footer)
* When I had a glance at the full webpage, I made some more changes to renaming my elements again.
* I try to comment on my HTML and CSS so I would not get confused and easy to work on again when I get back to it.
* How the lecture notes/student activities can be incorporated in my assignment and how I modified them to become one of my own codes. 
* Anchor linked the menu tabs so that it is enhance users assessbility and interface.
* Added Presuedo codes on the images so it is larger in size than the other
* I have also set the responsive mode to various screens so it can be viewed with different screen sizes.
* Always including "alt" tag after every image
